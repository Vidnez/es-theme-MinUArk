# Theme for the RGB30 based on ShaunInman's MinUI

**Jelos/Rocknix and ArkOS versions can be downloaded in the "releases" section.**

For a experience close to the original MinUI interface: 

- Set Transition Style to "Instant" and turn off carousel transitions (**ArkOS only**) in Start Menu > UI Settings.
- The theme is optimized for use screenshots for the "grid" and "detailed" view. Set the following options in the scraper:

	- **Image Source:** Screenshot
	- **Box source:** Box2D or Box3D
	- **Logo Source:** Wheel
 	- **Scrape Videos:** ON
